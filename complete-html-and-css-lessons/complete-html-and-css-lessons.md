### HTML and CSS

Many students who come to our program have a cursory knowledge of HTML and CSS.
Some are seasoned veterans of the front-end. In order for our educational
material to be accessible to developers of all skill levels, we choose to not
assume knowledge when creating our lessons.

Take the opportunity over the next few weeks to work through our lessons on
HTML and CSS. They cover the structure and presentation layers of the Web
Applications you will soon build. Whether these lessons serve as your first
glimpse into these technologies, or as a refresher course, please take the time
to work through them. HTML and CSS are the technologies we will use to build the
majority of applications in this course, so a solid foundation of knowledge in
these technologies is necessary for success.

There will not be a graded System Check for this material. There are no hard
deadlines for completion of this material. However, it is recommended that you
complete these lessons before starting on our JavaScript lessons, which will
come later in the course. (Week 8 of Ignition).

Our HTML and CSS lessons should be visible to you after clicking the "Curriculum"
link in the Navigation Bar, above.
